# Arduino Libraries

Here are a few of my Arduino libraries that someone may find useful.

### EMA (Exponential Moving Average)

This library calculates exponential moving averages (EMA) where the value is biased toward the most recent sample. This is in contrast to a simple moving average (SMA).

### Plot_u1

The Plot class helps you generate and accumulate variable strings to be sent to the Arduino IDE's Serial Plotter.
