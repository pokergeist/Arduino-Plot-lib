# AsyncTimer2

This is a fork of Luis Llamas' [AsyncTimerLib](https://github.com/luisllamasbinaburo/Arduino-AsyncTimer).

This library lets you configure timers and callbacks and optional parameters. Each time through loop() check your timers. There are a number of good features and options. AsyncTimerLib may be documented better. I use it for concurrent I2C and Serial message processing, blinking LEDs, mode switch timing, and sensor monitoring in one project alone. Handy stuff.

I tinkered with the constructors and default parameters to suit me, probably renamed a few things - it's been a while.

I plan to document this better at some point. We'll see how that goes.
